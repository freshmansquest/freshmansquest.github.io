            <h2>Team Story</h2>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>UFU Games was born as a project by an indie game studio called Gilp also based in Uberlãndia, Brazil. And as a project it is focused on introducing and building game developers, but it’s main purpose is to work as a full time independent game studio for new and creative minds. We are a full energy team thirsty for gaming and pop culture references but solid seekers of fun when it comes to pushing buttons and facing obstacles.</p>

                    <p>Freshman’s Quest is indeed the Freshman’s Quest for most of our members, the first spark of a lifetime spent in front of a pc screen or console controller now taken to create something new and above it all, fun. And that’s what we are all about, to create fun and challenging experiences based on our personal lifetime repertoire, and we’re loving every minute of it. Come join us.</p>
